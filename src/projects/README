Each directory contains a rez-based project, that can be built and installed with
'rez-build', and released with 'rez-release'. Some may depend on packages that
you need to provide, either by using the 'rez-ingest' tool, or by creating by
hand (see the wiki on how to do this). An example is the 'python' package.

These projects may not all do *exactly* what you want - there may be specific
things about how you install software at your studio that aren't accounted for -
but many will make a good starting point. You can copy these projects to your
own working directory and then modify them and add then to your own software
repository (git etc).

Please note that all packages here have a CMake-based build. Your own packages
may use a different build system, such as the inbuilt (and very simple and not
intended for complicated builds) 'bez' system. Or, you may have other build
systems implemented as Rez 'build_system' plugins that you may like to use. See
the wiki on how to do this.

To build a project:
]$ cd projects/PROJECT_NAME/
]$ rez-build

To locally install, then test:
]$ rez-build -i
... (build output)
]$ rez-env PROJECT_NAME
... (rez-env output)
]$ # now you're able to test

To release a project:
- Make a copy of the project;
- Add it to your repository of choice (git etc);
- Clone the source into a working directory;
]$ rez-release
